		"description": "Currently, I am employed full-time as a Software Engineer at OpenGov, where I continue to contribute to the Permitting and Licensing (PLC) team. In my role, I am dedicated to advancing my skills in frontend engineering, with a strong emphasis on building accessible user interfaces that ensure a seamless experience for all users. A key aspect of my work involves writing meaningful, well-structured tests to maintain high code quality and reliability across the platform. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve made it a priority to sharpen my expertise in accessibility best practices, ensuring that our applications meet the needs of diverse user groups. Looking ahead, one of my key professional goals for this year is to broaden my understanding of backend engineering, particularly around developing robust APIs and services. Additionally, I am excited to dive deeper into advanced testing methodologies such as PACT testing for contract testing and end-to-end (E2E) tests, which will help improve the overall reliability of our applications and streamline the deployment process. This will enable me to become a more well-rounded engineer and contribute to both frontend and backend development efforts."

		"description": "In the fall of my second year, I began tutoring Chemistry for UVA's School of Engineering. It was a learning curve figuring out how to teach complex concepts in an understandable manner. The next semester when I taught four different computer science courses, I was much more adept and the content was more familiar to me. From tutoring in computer science, I have become very skilled at debugging and trouble-shooting code quickly."

		"description": "In my second year I had the pleasure of working at Walker Upper Elementary School in Charlottesville, VA. There I assisted in a 5th grade classroom with students of varied learning levels. The class consisted of many non-native English speakers that needed additional assistance; I would work one-on-one with these students so that the teacher could focus on the rest of the class. This position taught me a lot about leadership and how to adapt people's learning styles in order to best help them."
